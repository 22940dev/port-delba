      "I had the privilege of working closely with Delba while rolling out a very complex program over the course of eight months. Delba was instrumental to the program's successful roll out and continued operations. She was always eager to help wherever she could and provided excellent documentation to the rest of the team, ensuring everyone knew exactly what to do. At our weekly planning meetings she would often raise points that the rest of the team had not considered while also providing solutions to the questions of other team members. I have enjoyed working with her immensely, and would jump at the opportunity to do so again in the future.",

She was a very dependable person, helping the team fix crucial bugs, pair programming and making the whole team feel great around her. She displayed strong mastery of React and CSS, implemented a chat feature using socket.io and even added emojis. She really showed devotion to the team and the project, and the outcome was an amazing application.",

And even more memorably, youâ€™re an exceptional human - a rather rare combination of acumen, empathy, values, drive and so many other traits I deeply admire. It was an honor working with you. Thank you for the opportunity to know you and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for you.",
